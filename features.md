# Retro tracking

**Within one day I want to be able to**:

- RT1: add time I spent on something
- RT2: update already added time
- RT3: delete already added time
- RT4: view already added time

**For > one day I want to be able to**:

- RT5: easily understand how I spend time for more than one day. This would require a different way of time representation compared to one day. Presumably this can be implemented in a form of charts

- RT7: Be able to see my top Goals and all the rest of the Goals when I want to
- RT8: Be able to see how much time I spent on a Goal
